This project includes a variety of different things built on top of
the [database library](https://github.com/susom/database).

### Features

* Basic ETL capabilities for moving data around efficiently between databases
* Database health checks for Vert.x based servers

In the future I plan to expand the ETL functionality, add reporting and analytics,
and add an EAV model, among other things.

### Getting Started

The library is available in the public Maven repository:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.susom</groupId>
  <artifactId>database-goodies</artifactId>
  <version>1.4</version>
</dependency>
```
